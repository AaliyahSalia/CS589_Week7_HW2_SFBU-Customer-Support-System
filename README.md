**Spec:**

SFBU Customer Support System - Speech to Text to Speech
Process for the project implementation
Step 1: Implement SFBU Customer Support System - text
Step 2: Implement Real-time Speech to Text to Speech : Building Your AI-Based Alexa
Step 3: Enhance Step 2 by adding the features of the project implemented in Step 1.
Hints: Two approaches on how to add the featurs
Option 1: Hard-coding the features on Step 2
Option 2: Using a library
Instead of hard-coding the features on Step 2, a better idea is to implement the features as libraries which can be used for both Step 1 and Step 2.
